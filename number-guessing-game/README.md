# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game allows you to compete with the computer to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is higher or lower than the computer's choice.

## How to Play
1. Clone the project repository from [python-projects](https://github.com/samuelogboye/python-projects).
2. Navigate to the number-guessing-game directory.
3. Run the Python script using python3 game.py command. or just ./game.py
4. You will be prompted with a welcome message and the number of guesses remaining.
5. Enter a number between 1 and 10 as your guess.
6. The computer will also randomly choose a number between 1 and 10.
7. The program will compare your guess with the computer's choice and provide feedback.
8. If your guess matches the computer's choice, you win the game.
9. If your guess is lower than the computer's choice, you will be prompted to try again with a higher number.
10. If your guess is higher than the computer's choice, you will be prompted to try again with a lower number.
11. After each guess, the number of remaining guesses will be decremented by 1.
12. Once you have exhausted all your guesses or if you win the game, you will be asked if you want to play again.
13. If you choose "yes", the game will restart with the initial number of guesses.
14. If you choose "no", the game will end, and a closing message will be displayed.
