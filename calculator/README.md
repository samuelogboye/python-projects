Requirements
To run the calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. The following are the requirements for the project:

Basic arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).
Support for both integers and floating-point numbers as input.
Advanced functionalities include:
Exponentiation (××)
Square root (√)
Logarithm operations (log)
Trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan)
Display clear and user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
Usage
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from python-projects.
Navigate to the calculator directory.
Run the calculator.py script using the command: python calculator.py.
The calculator will prompt you to enter the first number.
Enter the first number and press Enter.
Next, the calculator will prompt you to enter the operation you want to perform (+, -, ×, ÷, ××, √, log, sin, cos, tan).
Enter the operation and press Enter.
Based on the operation, the calculator will prompt you to enter the second number (if required).
Enter the second number (if applicable) and press Enter.
The calculator will display the result of the operation or an error message if the input is invalid.
Feel free to explore the various operations and functionalities of the calculator to perform complex calculations with ease.

Examples
Here are a few examples of how you can use the calculator:

Addition: Enter the first number, select the addition operation (+), enter the second number, and get the sum as the result.
Exponentiation: Enter the base number, select the exponentiation operation (××), enter the exponent, and get the result of raising the base to the exponent.
Square root: Enter the number, select the square root operation (√), and get the square root of the number.
Logarithm: Enter the number, select the logarithm operation (log), enter the base (optional, default is 10), and get the logarithm of the number with the specified base.
Trigonometric operations: Enter the angle in degrees, select the trigonometric operation (sin, cos, tan), and get the corresponding trigonometric value.
